## TODO

Here are some simple tasks you might want to tackle on your own:

- Store templates in tmpl/ and page data in data/.
- Add a handler to make the web root redirect to /view/FrontPage.
- Spruce up the page templates by making them valid HTML and adding some CSS rules.
- Implement inter-page linking by converting instances of `[PageName]` to `<a href="/view/PageName">PageName</a>`. (hint: you could use `regexp.ReplaceAllFunc` to do this)
