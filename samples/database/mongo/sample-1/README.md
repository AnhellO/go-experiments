# Simple Connection to Mongo

This sample waken from the official mongo docs at <https://www.mongodb.com/golang> and <https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/go>, and also modified it a bit with references taken from <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-go-with-mongodb-using-the-mongodb-go-driver-es>.

You should install MongoDB and start the service with `systemctl start mongod` in order to work with this sample. Alternatively, you can have Docker installed and execute the following command `docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name m1 mongo` in order to start a MongoDB container to play with.
